The Ipython notebook in this repository "P1.ipynb" describes a pipline used to identify lane lines in still
picutres and short videos. A number of functions are used to manually select importnat features of the 
images which iteratively classify areas of the image as lane lines.

Although technically a success, this classifier requires not only manually defined logic, but some pretty "hard" assumptions, the limitations of which are discussed in the conclusion.
